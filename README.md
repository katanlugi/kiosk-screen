# kiosk-screen

The goal of this project/demo was to test the feasibility of using a Raspberry Pi 3 connected to an HDTV as Digital Signage.

The display gives potential customer some useful local/regional information such as upcomming event, public transportation timetable and weather forcast.

The data source is partially taken from different APIs (http://transport.opendata.ch & http://openweathermap.org) and partially hardcoded.
